# bitcoin9000-mirror
A public mirror of the Bitcoin9000 paper on scaling Bitcoin.

DISCLAIMER: I am not the author of this paper, in case that's not obvious.

This paper was originally posted on GitHub at the beginning of March 2016 at
this URL:
https://github.com/goodsamaritan9000/scalingbitcoin/raw/master/Bitcoin9000.pdf

Unfortunately, the account and all data seems to have been removed.
I am not sure when this removal happened, but I only noticed on 28 March 2016.

I am putting up a mirror of this paper, which I downloaded myself from the original URL.
I do this as I believe the unknown author(s) meant for their Bitcoin scaling proposals
to be made available to the public in an unrestricted form.

The original paper has no designated author or license as far as I can tell.
